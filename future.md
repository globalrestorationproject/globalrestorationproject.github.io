There are no simple solutions to the existential threats posed by the agricultural crisis and climate crisis. These crises stem from humanity’s ecological, ethical, and social problems that disregard the living planet we share with other species.  Though some might consider the reforms we propose radical and unattainable, we worry they are not radical enough, given how critical the environmental and agriculture crises are.  Read on for our specific designs and our criteria for evaluating any proposals for a sustainable future. 

#### The Global Corporate Trust for Agroecological Integrity
We recommend the establishment of The Global Corporate Trust for Agroecological Integrity, a global-level institutional structure that coordinates a system of “eco-states” exercising “pluralistic sovereignty.”  This new international legal institution was first proposed in a 2019 publication, A Global Corporate Trust for Agroecological Integrity.  This new institution will be formed to uphold humanity’s responsibility as trustees of our planet.

This new international institutional utilizes a refashioned concept of sovereignty that gives special attention to pluralistic sovereignty involving territorially integrated operational networks, or “eco-states.”  The current framework of global governance around “nation states” creates national rivalries over natural resources and augurs against collective, collaborative arrangements.  Eco-states are cross-border entities, defined by ecological factors, with authority extending only to agroecological matters.  Eco-states represent a new system of global governance that embrace our vision of humanity as trustees of our living planet.  

Our vision for eco-states and the corresponding Global Corporate Trust for Agroecological Integrity is detailed in our publications, particularly the 2019 publication *A Global Corporate Trust for Agroecological Integrity* and the 2020 publication *Deep Agroecology and a New Homeric Epic*. 

#### Agroecological Husbandry
Extractive agriculture has dominated food production for thousands of years at the expense of the Earth’s soil, water, atmosphere, and biosphere.  We call for the development of a fundamentally different method of food production that offers a viable alternative to the traditional extractive agriculture that has brought ecological degradation. The new method we propose, using native ecosystems as a model, is agroecological husbandry.  Agroecological husbandry features perennial grains grown in polycultures with (i) close attention to the realities of the local ecosystem and (ii) an overriding mandate of ecological protection.  

The grains that dominate today’s agriculture production are annual plants that require physically or chemically tilling the soil.  Additionally, modern extractive agriculture now favors the growth of a single monocrop on the same field, with little, if any crop rotation.  Thus, food production using annual grains requires disturbance, causing soil degradation through erosion, damage to soil structure, and reduction in soil organic matter.  

Perennial polycultures hold the most promise for a new system of agriculture supplanting annual monocultures.  Perennial plants do not require yearly disturbance or removal, thriving on continuity and non-disturbance.  Most importantly, perennial polycultures mimic the natural order, diversity, and resilience of grasslands.  Perennial grains grown in polyculture would amass substantial ecological benefits: less fertilizer and pesticides required, less soil degradation, reduced water loss thanks to deeper roots, and carbon sequestration, just to name a few.  (For a more in-depth description of the benefits of perennial polycultures, please see our publication *Deep Agroecology and a New Homeric Epic*, Chapter 4).

#### Criteria for Future Solutions 
We have clear ideas about the general contours of the future we believe is both possible and necessary – necessary, that is, to assure a habitable Earth for future generations of our own species and for the other components and systems of our profoundly complex ecosphere. It is that very complexity, in fact, that lies at the foundation of our view of what a sustainable future must emphasize.

- **Nature as Measure.**  The future we plan to build will see humans seeing themselves as integrated with the rest of the natural world and sharing a “land ethic” of the sort Aldo Leopold urged. Good solutions will be those that accord with the realities of this natural world and that follow its patterns.
- **Green Technology.** Post-carbon, small-footprint, non-extractive, high-diversity technology developed with an overriding mandate of ecological protection.  However, we acknowledge that technology alone cannot solve a crisis that stems from humanity’s exploitative attitude towards our living planet.
- **Collective Effort.** Global crises require global conscience & cooperation.  International regimes, guided by eco-centric principles, provide the best means for achieving the extensive transformation necessary to solve the agriculture and climate crises.
