There are no simple solutions to the existential threats posed by the agricultural crisis, the energy crisis, and climate crisis. These crises stem from humanity’s ecological, ethical, and social problems that disregard the living planet we share with other species.  Though some might consider the reforms we propose radical and unattainable, we worry they are not radical enough, given how deep these crises of ecology, energy, and agriculture have become.  

Read on for some of the specific designs that the Global RESTORATION Project has formulated thus far, and to see our criteria for evaluating any proposals for a sustainable future. And **please** contribute your own ideas for building a sustainable future in terms of energy, technology, agroecological, and governance – to see how to make this contribution (and remember, we are *not*  asking for money), go to [“What You Can Do”](https://globalrestorationproject.org/whatyoucando/).  We welcome all ideas aimed at this destination, whether they agree with our own or not.  

#### Global Institutional Reform
We see a future in which the primacy of ecological concerns is assured at the global level, through innovative institutional structures.  Once specific recommendation along these lines calls for the Global Corporate Trust for Agroecological Integrity, a global-level institutional structure that coordinates a system of “eco-states” exercising “pluralistic sovereignty.”  This new international legal institution was first proposed in a 2019 publication, *A Global Corporate Trust for Agroecological Integrity*.  

This new international institution would utilize a refashioned concept of sovereignty that gives special attention to pluralistic sovereignty involving territorially integrated operational networks, or “eco-states.”  The current framework of global governance around “nation states” creates national rivalries over natural resources and augurs against collective, collaborative arrangements.  Eco-states are cross-border entities, defined by ecological factors, with authority extending only to agroecological matters.  Eco-states represent a new system of global governance that embrace our vision of humanity as trustees of our living planet.  

Our vision for eco-states and the corresponding Global Corporate Trust for Agroecological Integrity is detailed in our publications, particularly the 2019 publication *A Global Corporate Trust for Agroecological Integrity* and the 2020 publication *Deep Agroecology and a New Homeric Epic*. These ideas have also been presented at conferences in various locations, including Sweden, Sicily, British Columbia, and Kansas.

#### Agroecological Husbandry -- Natural-Systems Agriculture
Extractive agriculture has dominated food production for thousands of years at the expense of the Earth’s soil, water, atmosphere, and biosphere.  We call for the development of a fundamentally different method of food production that offers a viable alternative to the traditional extractive agriculture that has brought ecological degradation. The new method we endorse, using native ecosystems as a model, is referred to as “natural-systems agriculture” or “agroecological husbandry” – drawing from the notion of “husbanding”, or caring for, the land through sustainable farming practices (which, as a historical reality, has been carried out mostly by women, not by men … so “husbandry” in this context has no connection to “husband and wife” terminology).  Agroecological husbandry features perennial grains grown in polycultures with (i) close attention to the realities of the local ecosystem and (ii) an overriding mandate of ecological protection.  

The grains that dominate today’s agriculture production are annual plants that require physically or chemically tilling the soil.  Additionally, modern extractive agriculture now favors the growth of a single monocrop on the same field, with little, if any crop rotation.  Thus, food production using annual grains requires disturbance, causing soil degradation through erosion, damage to soil structure, and reduction in soil organic matter.  

Perennial polycultures hold the most promise for a new system of agriculture supplanting annual monocultures.  Perennial plants do not require yearly disturbance or removal, thriving on continuity and non-disturbance.  Most importantly, perennial polycultures mimic the natural order, diversity, and resilience of grasslands.  Perennial grains grown in polyculture would amass substantial ecological benefits: less fertilizer and pesticides required, less soil degradation, reduced water loss thanks to deeper roots, and carbon sequestration, just to name a few.  (For a more in-depth description of the benefits of perennial polycultures, please see the publication *Deep Agroecology and a New Homeric Epic*, Chapter 4[^1]).

#### Criteria for Future Solutions 
We have clear ideas about the general contours of the future we believe is both possible and necessary – necessary, that is, to assure a habitable Earth for future generations of our own species and for the other components and systems of our profoundly complex ecosphere. It is that very complexity, in fact, that lies at the foundation of our view of what a sustainable future must emphasize.

- **Nature as Measure.**  The future we plan to build will see humans seeing themselves as integrated with the rest of the natural world and sharing a “land ethic” of the sort Aldo Leopold urged. Good solutions will be those that accord with the realities of this natural world and that follow its patterns.
- **Green Technology.** Post-carbon, small-footprint, non-extractive, high-diversity technology developed with an overriding mandate of ecological protection.  However, we acknowledge that technology alone cannot solve a crisis that stems from humanity’s exploitative attitude towards our living planet.
- **Collective Effort.** Global crises require global conscience cooperation.  International regimes, guided by eco-centric principles, provide the best means for achieving the extensive transformation necessary to solve the agriculture and climate crises.
