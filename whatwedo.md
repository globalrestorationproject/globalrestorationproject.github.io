* **Collaborative Research.**  Just as the Global Restoration Project encompasses a cluster of distinct areas of expertise, many of our members combine backgrounds in law and policy relating to energy, ecology, intellectual property, agriculture, international relations, and more.  But we do not concentrate solely on law and policy:  our members also contribute expertise in geology, technology, climate change, crop science, and earth sciences generally – even art and philosophy.  With this array of experience and interest, we collaborate in our research in order to achieve solutions that no single discipline can hope to offer.

* **Education & Advocacy.**  Driven by a sense of high urgency, we will plan and facilitate programs for training and education to audiences whose informed engagement in political and social arenas will be crucial to mustering the collective political action necessary to address the problems – primarily ecological in character – that stands at the center of the Global Restoration Project's agenda.  And we engage in advocacy by preparing proposals, white papers, and publication summaries for broad distribution and understanding.

* **Conferences.**  Consistent with both of the two above points – collaborative research and education & advocacy – we organize, host, and participate in conferences at which those challenges central to the Global Restoration Project's aims can be illuminated and discussed ... with a particular keenness on having publications emerge from such conferences in order to push the discourse forward on as many fronts as possible – including at the international level.

* **Clearinghouse Functions.**  We listen to and watch for the important work of others – writers, scholars, activists, bloggers, policy-makers, and others, from the private sector, the academic community, the NGO world, and government agencies – in order to provide linkages and updates for the benefit of all who share our vision and seek solutions to ecological degradation. 

* **“Working Papers” Series.**  To encourage close interaction and broad participation, we manage a brisk, informal, cross-disciplinary Working Paper series.  We invite contributors to submit papers for light review and quick turn-around for electronic posting on our [website](globalrestorationproject.github.io) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JohnWarrenHead).  For illustrations of some "Working Papers", see [here.](https://globalrestorationproject.github.io/workingpapers/)

* **Global Attention & Innovation.**  Through all our work, we emphasize the reality that global issues require global solutions.  Whether those solutions are multilateral in character (reflecting official nation-state structures) or are instead “civil-society” in character (reflecting the dramatic momentum of recent years toward non-state-actor leadership), or are instead of some altogether novel character – these are matters yet to be established.  Our approach to all our activities (research, education, conferences, advocacy, etc.) emphasizes, celebrates, and indeed mandates innovative thinking.
