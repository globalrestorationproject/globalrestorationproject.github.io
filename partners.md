We have recently added this page to list **Colleagues, Contributors and Commentators.** These "fellow travellers" include (1) colleagues in various research, think-tank, and academic institutions, as well as fellow researchers in the areas of most concern to the Project, plus (2) persons who accept our invitation to write essays, provide commentaries & criticisms, or make other contributions to the GRP's work. In all such cases, though, we emphasize that the material shown on the website does not necessarily reflect the views of persons listed here.
