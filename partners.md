We have recently added this page to acknowledge that the Global Restoration Project benefits from input from many contributors, critics, and commentators. They come from various research, think-tank, and academic institutions, and some of them have written essays and participated in the “Dialogues” segment of our bi-weekly newsletters, the [*GRP Gazette*](https://globalrestorationproject.substack.com/). Please consider becoming a Colleague!
