### Commentary: Regenerative Agriculture Featured in *Vogue* as Fashion Moves Beyond Sustainability

**Author: Emily Otte** 

Commenting on *Regenerative Agriculture Can Change the Fashion Industry--And the World. But What Is It?* by Emily Farra for *Vogue*, available  [here](https://www.vogue.com/article/regenerative-agriculture-sustainable-fashion-christy-dawn-fibershed). 

Journalist Emma Farra wrote a thoughtful, useful primer on “regenerative agriculture” in fashion for *Vogue*.  The Global Restoration Project sees regenerative agriculture as 
an important, but imperfect, step forward.  Importantly, we see this piece as a reminder of the wide reach of agricultural issues; it isn’t often that farming and fashion 
intersect.  

Regenerative agriculture seeks to move beyond sustainability. In the piece, a fashion executive says, “The word sustainable is like a dinosaur now.”  Instead of organic or 
sustainable farming, Farra explains that regenerative agriculture “replenishes and strengthens the plants, the soil, and the nature surrounding it.”  Regenerative agriculture
utilizes techniques like cover crops, pollinator strips, and trap crops, to mimic the diversity of nature. The result is “rich, nutrient-dense soil” that produces stronger crops and those crops, in turn, sequester carbon through photosynthesis.  Farra reminds us that these techniques are not new and radical; one brand said farmers in India felt 
like they were returning to traditional agricultural practices.  

The Global Restoration Project encourages those pursuing regenerative agriculture to think deeper.  Low-impact, carbon capturing agricultural practices are an important 
step forward, but the deep agroecology for which we advocate envisions perennial polycultures.  The inclusion of cover crops, pollinator strips, and trap crops could be a 
useful example of a polyculture but regenerative farming could be even more regenerative-- fewer chemicals, better crops, and more carbon sequestration-- if perennials were used. 
Additionally, Farra mentions that brands will have to invest capital in regenerative farming methods; perennials could help lower costs for brands and farmers.  The Global Restoration Project remains hopeful and encouraged that fashion is a promising vehicle for moving these conversations into the mainstream.
