##### The Global Restoration Projects believes that radical transformation of humanity's relationship with nature and, accordingly, a radical transformation of modern agriculture, is not only possible, but necessary, to save and restore a living planet earth.  We believe in an eco-centric approach to solving the climate crisis and the agricultural crisis that utilizes **Responsible Energy, Smart Technology, and a Organic and Resilient Agroecology** to develop a new natural-systems form of agriculture that will reverse  environmental degradation.   

With this commitment, we seek answers to a fundamental question: how can humans today so order, or reorder, their lives in ways that will preserve the planet we share with other species?

Addressing that question requires a viewpoint that is not predominantly anthropomorphic in character.  Hence we wince at the term "Antropocene" to describe our current age: the reality that *homo sapiens* now have a stranglehold over the natural systems of the Earth - and that this single species can (and does) alter those systems in ways that have yet-known consequences - is chilling to us. 

Addressing the question posed above - how humans can reorder their lives to preserve the planet - also involves the **fourth component** of the Global Restoration Project.  We call for the creation of "Territorially Integrated Operational Networks".  This effort involves legal and institutional reform at the most fundamental levels - even to the extent of challenging the dominance that the nation-state system has held over the global political structure for several hundred years. 

Hence, legal reform is central to the mission of the Global Restoration Project.  We believe that the move to a post-carbon world by developing responsible energy sources is possible only if law, as a powerful social institution, is mobilized effectively to make that move a reality.  Likewise, we believe that the development of smart technology and the transformation of agriculture are possible only if law is mobilized effectively to make each of those developments a reality.  Legislative proposals, litigation strategies, regulatory regimes â€“ all these are within the purview of our work at the Global Restoration Project, and in that regard we focus efforts at the national level, where most legal initiatives start and most legal solutions can be found.

We also believe that fundamental legal reform is now both mandatory and possible at the international level as well.  The notion of sovereignty, established in the peculiarities of a 17th-century European political and religious landscape, offers little durable hope for addressing the global issues that face us in the 21st century.  Accordingly, we call for institutional and structural reform involving dramatically broader participation by citizen groups, by scientific professionals, and by all affected parties at the global level.
