Author: Sam Walter

Our current agriculture system is unsustainable, but shifting toward a new system will require the development of new variety of plant species.  This paper examines the wide variety of legal regimes governing seeds and other plant genetic material and argues that international treaties are promoting the conservation pf plant genetic resoruces, but there is work to be done to improve the utility and coverage of seed bank collections.

##### Inching Forward, Legislative Steps Toward Sustainable Agriculture in the United States
Author: Mary Kate Workman

Agricultural policy in the United States subsidizes conventional agriculture, rather than sustainable agriculture, to the detriment of our ecosystems and our climate.  The U.S. lags behind the international community in adopting sustainable agricultural practices.  This piece lists U.S. legislative efforts to adopt a more sustainable agriculture and argues that the current efforts are still largely anthropocentric and inadequate.

Though by no means comprehensive, the survey provides a rich reservoir of information about "agrarian" wroting and advocacy.

##### CITA Working Papers
For several years, a Center for International Trade and Agriculture operated out of the University of Kansas Law School.  Some of the Working Papers that were published (online) by the CITA have direct relevance to themes that are central to the Global Restoration Project.  For easy access to readers and researchers, five such Working Papers can be found [here.](http://law.ku.edu/cita/#working-papers)  These two hold particular relevance to participants in the Global Restoration Project: [Paper 1](http://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/centers/CITA_working_paper1_2010.pdf) and [Paper 5](http://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/centers/CITA-working-paper5-2016-caleb-hall.pdf) .
