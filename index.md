**Why we want you here:** (1) to *contribute* ideas, links to related organizations, and energy (**not money**) to the Global Restoration Project and (2) to *benefit* from the resources that the GRP povides - information, contacts, essays, and more.  For details, see the "What You Can Do" page, under the "About Us" tab. Also, as we continue developing the GRP (and our website), we welcome any suggestions and questions you might have.  Suggestions can be directed to Contact@GlobalRestorationProject.org.
