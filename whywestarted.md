The establishment of the Global Restoration Project in 2020 arose from a combination of alarm and inspiration.  **Alarm** because far too little attention is given to a cluster of integrated environmental and legal issues facing our species today.  Yes, many experts advocate change in energy policy at a global scale, especially to wean humans off of fossil carbon.  And yes, many experts study how to reform agriculture to reduce its ecological impact.  For us, though, a great many of those proposals are narrow half-measures that fail to address the whole cluster of problems.  

Hence our decision to combine the four key elements of the GRP – that is, Responsible Energy, Smart Technology, Organic Regenerative Agroecology, and Territorially Integrated Operational Networks.  In a nutshell, we started the Global Restoration Project to hasten a collective realization that dramatic changes must come rapidly to energy policy, technological development, agricultural systems, and global governance – all as explained in more detail below. 

And what about **inspiration**?  For each of these four elements, we also identify below some specific sources of inspiration for the GRP’s initial location in Kansas.

#### Responsible Energy 
Energy use must be reduced, and energy supplies must be shifted away from fossil fuels immediately.  The environmental damage to all the planet’s processes – in the hydrosphere, the lithosphere, the biosphere, and especially the atmosphere – grows deeper with every passing day because of **ir**responsible energy policy.  

Although the GRP has an international field of view, we have drawn some inspiration from the fact that Kansas has started taking alternative-energy initiatives, including a remarkably robust development of wind-generated energy. According to the American Wind Energy Association, wind accounted for 41.4% of the electricity generated in Kansas in 2019, compared to 7.2% nationally and second only to Iowa at 41.9%. Importantly, the Global Restoration project opposes all wind-generated energy that (i) interferes significantly with wildlife habitat, (ii) costs more (when externalities are captured) than it yields, and/or (iii) creates out-of-human-scale landscapes. But to the extent that wind, solar, geo-thermal, or other energy initiatives offer valid alternatives to fossil-carbon-based energy, the Global Restoration Project supports them.

#### Smart Technology
Technological “solutions” can succeed only if they mimic nature and thus foster a localized, resilient, sustainable, human-scale reintegration of our own species into processes and relationships that make ours a living planet.  Moreover, in exploring technological innovations, we must recognize the fact that our own ignorance (especially as a species) far outweighs our understanding.  Hence we must hew to a precautionary principle that prohibits introducing new technology without proof of its safety for ourselves and succeeding generations of all species and systems.  (For more on the GRP's definition of Smart Technology, see [this working paper](https://globalrestorationproject.org/2020-12-22-smart-technology-grp/)). 

Although the GRP has an international perspective, we have drawn some inspiration from the fact that technological innovation abounds in Kansas, as evidenced by its aviation and agriculture industries. Wichita has long been a robust hub of aerospace design and manufacturing and Kansas is at the forefront of agricultural science and technology, led by efforts at Kansas State University. Notably, some such technology runs in the wrong direction, and we reject the view that technology will provide some “silver bullet” to relieve this generation of humans of its responsibility to reverse environmental degradation and to restore natural system on a planetary scale. Still, we support smart technological innovation that will allow for a localized, resilient, sustainable, human-scale reintegration of our own species into processes and relationships that make ours a living planet.

#### Organic Regenerative Agroecology
The form of agriculture practiced for several thousand years can now be transformed into a natural-systems form of food production that breaks the dependence on those aspects of the Green Revolution requiring massive synthetic additives to push artificial yields from annual grains grown in monocultures.  We regard agriculture, energy, and technology as intrinsically bound together; their guiding policies must blend.

Although the GRP has an international reach, we have drawn some inspiration from the fact that Kansas is the home state for The Land Institute, the world’s leading research institute for developing perennial grains, such as Kernza (R). Now, the Land Institute is focusing also on developing the mixtures (polycultures) of species in which those perennial grains can be most productive. Embracing, but moving beyond, the values of “organic” agriculture, researchers at The Land Institute have built noteworthy momentum both on the perennialization front and on the polyculture/ecology front - leading now to a growing acknowledgement in the scientific community that a natural-systems form of agriculture is both resilient and feasible. (For more on the GRP’s definition of Organic Regenerative Agroecology, see [this working paper](https://globalrestorationproject.org/2021-01-10-organic-restorative-agroecology/)). On his retirement from a widely-renowned legal academic career, Professor George Coggins of the University of Kansas authored a book entitled *Restoration*. In that work, he summed up a career’s worth of knowledge of and dedication to natural-resource preservation by offering a menu of recommendations for restoring native habitats following decades of reckless degradation.

#### Territorially Integrated Operational Networks
Legal and institutional reforms at the global level are needed to facilitate all the policy changes referred to above in energy, technology, and agriculture.  Our planet’s system of governance for the past 400 years has been dominated by hoary notions of state sovereignty designed for a handful of ambitious monarchs in a tiny segment of the globe.  Our species should be able to show the maturity now to design and implement new forms of democratic, diverse, cooperative laws and institutions for managing social matters (involving only our own species) and environmental matters (involving all species).   

Although the GRP has an international focus, we have drawn some inspiration from the fact that Kansas, both legal and historical aspects of environmental governance have long been topics of study and expertise at the University of Kansas. For instance, several KU Law School faculty members have written extensively on water law (John Peck), natural-resources and public-lands management (George Coggins), environmental protection (Rob Glicksman), agricultural law (Keith Meyer), international agroecological reform (John Head), and energy-environment legislative and policy issues (Uma Outka). The sub-discipline of environmental history was developed in large part by long-time KU Professor Don Worster, whose many writings include a biography of John Wesley Powell. Powell’s proposal in the late 1800s to bring new western states into the USA along watershed boundaries serves as a key inspiration for the idea of “eco-states” that intrigues us at the Global Restoration Project. (For a description and an image of Powell’s “watershed map”, see [The United Watershed States of America: A Biography of John Wesley Powell - Brandon Letsinger](https://thebioregionalist.com/biography/the-united-watershed-states-of-america-a-biography-of-john-wesley-powell/)).
