The establishment of the **Global Restoration Project** in 2020 - and in particular its initial location in Kansas - reflects several sources of inspiration: 
* Kansas has started taking **alternative-energy initiatives**, including a remarkably robust development of wind-generated energy.  According to the American Wind Energy Association, wind accounted for **41.4%** of the electricity generated in Kansas in 2019, compared to 7.2% nationally and second only to Iowa at 41.9%.  Importantly, the Global Restoration project **opposes** all wind-generated energy that (i) interferes significantly with wildlife habitat, (ii) costs more (when externalities are captured) than it yields, and/or (iii) creates out-of-human-scale landscapes.  But to the extent that wind, solar, geo-thermal, or other energy initiatives offer valid alternatives to fossil-carbon-based energy, the Global Restoration Project supports them.  

* **Technological innovation** abounds in Kansas, as evidenced by its aviation and agriculture industries.  Wichita has long been a robust hub of aerospace design and manufacturing and Kansas is at the forefront of agricultural science and technology, led by efforts at Kansas State University.  Notably, some such technology runs in the wrong direction, and we reject the view that technology will provide some "silver bullet" to relieve this generation of humans of its responsibility to relieve this generation of humans of its responsibility to reverse environmental degradation and to restore natural system on a planetary scale.  Still, we support smart technological innovation that will allow for a localized, resilient, sustainable, human-scale reintegration of our own species into processes and relationships that make ours a living planet. 

* Turning to **agroecology**:  Kansas is the home state for The Land Institute, the world's leading research institute for developing perennial grains, such as Kernza (*R*).  Now, the Land Institute is focusing also on developing the mixtures (polycultures) of species in which those perennial grains can be most productive.  Embracing, but moving beyond, the values of "organic" agriculture, researchers at The Land Institute have built noteworthy momentum both on the perennialization front and on the polyculture/ecology front - leading now to a growing acknowledgement in the scientific community that a natural-systems form of agriculture is both resilient and feasible. 

* On his retirement from a widely-renowned legal academic career, Professor George Coggins of the University of Kansas authored a book entitled *Restoration*.
