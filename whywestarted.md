The establishment of the Global Restoration Project in 2020 - and in particular its initial location in Kansas - reflects several sources of inspiration.  Here are some of them, organized in terms of the four key elements of the GRP -- that is, Responsible Energy, Smart Technology, Organic Regenerative Agroecology, and Territorially Integrated Operational Networks:

#### Responsible Energy 
Kansas has started taking alternative-energy initiatives, including a remarkably robust development of wind-generated energy.  According to the American Wind Energy Association, wind accounted for 41.4% of the electricity generated in Kansas in 2019, compared to 7.2% nationally and second only to Iowa at 41.9%.  Importantly, the Global Restoration project opposes all wind-generated energy that (i) interferes significantly with wildlife habitat, (ii) costs more (when externalities are captured) than it yields, and/or (iii) creates out-of-human-scale landscapes.  But to the extent that wind, solar, geo-thermal, or other energy initiatives offer valid alternatives to fossil-carbon-based energy, the Global Restoration Project supports them.

#### Smart Technology
Technological innovation abounds in Kansas, as evidenced by its aviation and agriculture industries.  Wichita has long been a robust hub of aerospace design and manufacturing and Kansas is at the forefront of agricultural science and technology, led by efforts at Kansas State University.  Notably, some such technology runs in the wrong direction, and we reject the view that technology will provide some "silver bullet" to relieve this generation of humans of its responsibility  to reverse environmental degradation and to restore natural system on a planetary scale.  Still, we support smart technological innovation that will allow for a localized, resilient, sustainable, human-scale reintegration of our own species into processes and relationships that make ours a living planet.

#### Organic Regenerative Agroecology
Kansas is the home state for The Land Institute, the world's leading research institute for developing perennial grains, such as Kernza (*R*).  Now, the Land Institute is focusing also on developing the mixtures (polycultures) of species in which those perennial grains can be most productive.  Embracing, but moving beyond, the values of "organic" agriculture, researchers at The Land Institute have built noteworthy momentum both on the perennialization front and on the polyculture/ecology front - leading now to a growing acknowledgement in the scientific community that a natural-systems form of agriculture is both resilient and feasible. (For more on the GRP's definition of Organic Regenerative Agroecology, see [this working paper](https://globalrestorationproject.github.io/2021-01-10-organic-restorative-agroecology/)). 
On his retirement from a widely-renowned legal academic career, Professor George Coggins of the University of Kansas authored a book entitled *Restoration*. In that work, he summed up a career’s worth of knowledge of and dedication to natural-resource preservation by offering a menu of recommendations for restoring native habitats following decades of reckless degradation.

#### Territorially Integrated Operational Networks
Both legal and historical aspects of environmental governance have long been topics of study and expertise at the University of Kansas.  For instance, several KU Law School faculty members have written extensively on water law (John Peck), natural-resources and public-lands management (George Coggins), environmental protection (Rob Glicksman), agricultural law (Keith Meyer), international agroecological reform (John Head), and energy-environment legislative and policy issues (Uma Outka).  The sub-discipline of environmental history was developed in large part by long-time KU Professor Don Worster, whose many writings include a biography of John Wesley Powell.  Powell’s proposal in the late 1800s to bring new western states into the USA along watershed boundaries serves as a key inspiration for the idea of “eco-states” that intrigues us at the Global Restoration Project.  (For a description and an image of Powell’s “watershed map”,  see [The United Watershed States of America: A Biography of John Wesley Powell - Brandon Letsinger](https://thebioregionalist.com/biography/the-united-watershed-states-of-america-a-biography-of-john-wesley-powell/)).
